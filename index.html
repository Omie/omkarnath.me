                <p>I learned to code only because of awesome internet communities.<br />
                   During my graduation, which I did in Commerce, I had no formal education of
                   computer science or programming.<br />
                   Its because of internet communities I got to learn something new everyday, I could
                   explore the new technologies and develop a wide skillset.

                           Since 2005, I was active on the forums hosted by a tech magazine called Chip at chip-india.com. (This site is now closed down.)<br />
                           Most important thing I learned from this forum was, how to use 'teh interwebs' to
                           get most out of it.<br />
                           This knowledge and some awesome online friends is what I owe to chip-india.com
